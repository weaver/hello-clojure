      <h1>Welcome to the Lobby</h1>
      <p>When you walk through the doorway you notice a fine layer of
	dust has settled over the floor and all the furniture. You
	look around for other travelers, but find that you're all
	alone! A large glowing screen is attached to the south
	wall. As you walk toward it, you make can see it's a chat
	transcript of some kind. Should you leave a message?</p>
